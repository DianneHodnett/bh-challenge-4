// TODO Challenge 4

// Create a parent container component
//    Have an input that will take a phrase and pass it's value down to its two children
//    Have two children components (make the folders here)
//        One that will show the reverse of the string
//            This component should have a radio input that will change the direction from being normal to reverse
//            It should effect both it's output but also the output for the filtered component
//        One that will filter out characters from the string
//            This component will have an additional input that will be used to filter characters
